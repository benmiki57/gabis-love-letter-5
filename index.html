        <h1>My lovely Gabi <span class="heart">♡</span></h1>
        
        <p>I wish I could tell you how much I love you, yet the word "love" can't explain how much "I love you" truly means. If there were a word in existence that could capture it, I would use it to tell you how special you are to me, my love. But there isn't any that can fully explain it, and so here I am writing this so at least you know how much you mean to me, my love.</p>

        <p>I have never been so good at telling people my emotions, but when I'm with you, my love, I can't wait to explain it to you. Ever since I saw you for who you truly are, life has been beautiful. I can't imagine an existence without you because, my love, you have given my withering soul new life. You have made me realize that there is more—the way you call my name, the way you talk to me gently yet firmly, and the feeling you give me whenever you talk to me, kiss me, hold my hand, and tell me how much you love me.</p>

        <p>Oh, how I am blessed indeed to be loved by a pure soul that is all but love. I remember the day we texted, not knowing the love I would harbor for you, the love we would have, the life I never thought I would love. I never knew I could be with someone who would bring love so uncontrollable that it makes me buckle under the weight.no matter how much i say i love you i will always love even beyond that my love.</p>

        <p>Oh, how I love you, my dear. There might be thousands, millions of things that can make me happy and make me smile like a child who just got an ice cream, but my love, you are my most favorite one of them all. I love the memories you gave me, the smiles, and the times when you were by my side when I just needed someone. You are truly a pure soul, my love. My heart is full of you—I can hardly even call it my own anymore.</p>

        <p>My dearest Gabi,</p>

        <p>words will never fully capture the depth of what you mean to me, but every beat of my heart screams your name. You are my light in every darkness, my reason to smile even on the hardest days, and the only future I ever want to imagine. I promise to keep loving you with everything I am—fiercely, gently, endlessly—until the stars fade and beyond. Thank you for choosing me, for healing me, for being you.</p>

        <p class="signature">Forever yours, completely and utterly in love,<br>Benon <span class="heart">♡</span></p>
